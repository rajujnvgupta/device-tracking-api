# Setup


# Note this project has been Developed and Tested on Ubuntu localy after that hosted over AWS cloud.


# STEP 1 -> Mongo installation for linux ubuntu 20.04
    https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/

# STEP 2 -> install dependency for develpment
    pip3 install pymongo fastapi uvicorn redis
    # fastapi is python web framwork for api develpment
    # pymongo is python client for mongodb connection
    # uvicorn act as server for development & testing
    # redis used for cacheing


# STEP 3 ->  clone code from my github
    git clone GITHUT url

# STEP 5 -> start redis on default --port 6379

    sudo systemctl start redis
    sudo systemctl status redis

# STEP 5 -> start mongod on default --port 27017
    sudo systemctl status mongod
    sudo systemctl status mongod

# STEP 6 -> start uvicor server for development & testing
uvicorn index:app --reload --port 8080 --host 0.0.0.0

# Reason for using mongo db
USED non-relational database because data we received not very much relation and huge amount of data will be create.
To handle such a huge amount of mongodb is good fit. mongodb is very much scalable and provides powerfull
indexing technique which we can used to perform faster query and highly scalable.

Mongodb can be scalled horizontally to handle huge amount of data traffic.

# Reason to Use FastAPI
FastAPI is very fast in term of development and performence because it is build on top of asyncronous nature of python.

# Note
# hosted and tested on ubuntu 20.04 machine




sudo su -
